1. requirement specifications
    have user input a, b, c and make it so it calculates the zeros of a given quadratic

2. system analysis
    r1 = (-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a
    r2 = (-b - sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

    b^2 - 4ac

3. system design
    a. prompt user
    b. have user enter in a b and c
    c. calculate how many zeros there are
    d. if no zeros, say no zeros
    e. if more than that calculate the zeros
    d. print a message
